PennMUSH 2.0.

A hopefully mostly backwards compatible featurewise version of
PennMUSH written in a more modern style fixing many problems with Penn
1.X. Plus Unicode!

Requires the Boost libraries. Some package mangers/OSes include all
component libraries of Boost in one blob, others split them up. Penn 2
uses: ASIO, Locale, Regex, Program_Options, Log, Thread.

It also requires a C++ compiler that supports C++11, and a standard
POSIX environment. Windows is probably not suitable.
